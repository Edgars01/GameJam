        <h1 class="factsHeader">Robot Facts</h1>

            <h2 class="smallerFactsHeader">What Do Robots Do?</h2>

                <p class="factsParagraph">Robots are sometimes thought of as devices for the far-off future, or as something in science fiction. But the truth is that robots are part of our lives today. In fact, robots are all around us! Our world is inhabited by machines that can talk to us, listen to us, perform as asked, and even solve problems without specific direction from humans. However, the most common uses of robots involve them acting as substitutes for human labor, doing work that humans could do but that robots are better suited for.</p>
            
                <p class="factsParagraph">Imagine you worked at a factory, and your job was to tighten one screw on a toaster. And imagine that you did this action over and over again, on toaster after toaster, day after day, for weeks, months or years. This kind of job is better done by robots than by humans. Most robots today are used to do repetitive actions, or jobs considered too dangerous for humans. A robot is ideal for going into a building that has a possible bomb. Robots are also used in factories to build things like cars, candy bars, and electronics. Robots are now used in medicine, for military tactics, for finding objects underwater and to explore other planets. Robotic technology has helped people who have lost arms or legs. Robots are a great tool to help mankind.</p>
                
            <h2 class="smallerFactsHeader">So Why Use Robots?</h2>

                <p class="factsParagraph">One reason robots are used is that it is often cheaper to use them instead of humans. It is easier to have robots do some jobs, and sometimes using robots is the only possible way to accomplish some tasks. Robots can explore inside gas tanks, deep under the ocean, or inside volcanoes. They can explore the surface of Mars, search for survivors after a disaster, or go to dangerous places where extreme temperatures or contaminated environments exist.</p>
            
                <p class="factsParagraph">Robots can also do the same thing over and over again without getting bored. They can drill, they can weld, they can paint, they can handle hazardous materials, and in some situations, robots are much more accurate than a human ‐ which can cut back on production costs, mistakes or hazards. Robots never get sick, don't need sleep, don't need food, don't need to take a day off, and best of all they don't ever complain! There are a lot of benefits to using robots.</mark>.</p>
        
            <h2 class="smallerFactsHeader">Nanorobots</h2>

                <p class="factsParagraph">Nano-robots or nanobots are robots scaled down to microscopic size in order to put them into very small spaces to perform a function. Currently nanobots are still in the developmental stage. Future nanobots could be placed in the blood stream to perform surgical procedures that are too delicate or too difficult for standard surgery. Nanobots could fight bacteria by tracking down and eliminating each bacterial cell or could repair individual organ cells in the body.</p>
            
                <p class="factsParagraph">Imagine if a nanobot could target cancer cells and destroy them without touching healthy cells nearby. Nanobots would probably carry medication and surgical tools on board. They would need to be able to navigate through the human body and then find their way out too. Nanobots could be used in other situations too. Tiny nanobot gears and tools could allow construction of objects at the tiniest of scale. Some of the things we only imagine in science fiction could one day be reality. Maybe you will one day be a scientist who works with nanobots.</mark>.</p>
      
            <h2 class="smallerFactsHeader">Robots in Space</h2>

                <p class="factsParagraph">Robots are especially useful in space exploration because, unlike human explorers, they can survive in space for long periods of time and can safely do things that humans cannot do. They can be built to do things that would be too risky or impossible for astronauts. For example, they can withstand harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures on distant planets or high levels of radiation. They can collect samples, take measurements, and send pictures back to Earth.</p>
      
                <p class="factsParagraph">Robotic arms on spacecraft such as the International Space Station are used to move large objects in space. NASA rovers like Curiosity or Perseverance are used to explore Mars. New robots for space exploration are being developed all the time. A foldable robot called A-PUFFER was developed to explore regions on the moon. BRUIE is a robot designed to explore under ice surfaces, such as the underground oceans of Jupiter’s moon Europa. A robot called Hedgehog is being developed to explore asteroids and comets.</p>
      
                <p class="factsParagraph">It takes a lot of people working together to design and build these complex robots. Electrical engineers design the circuitry, mechanical engineers design the robot’s body or arm, and computer engineers develop the programming and communication systems. Perhaps someday you will help invent new robots to explore beyond our planet. Learn more about the use of robots in space.</p>

            <h2 class="smallerFactsHeader">Artificial Intelligence</h2>

                <p class="factsParagraph">Some computers and robots have been developed to act with human-like behavior. A machine with artificial intelligence is one that can perceive its environment and change its behavior accordingly, while using tools at hand to solve problems or reach goals it has been programmed to achieve. Face recognition software, complicated scheduling software, or computer games that give players a response based on the players’ actions are all forms of artificial intelligence. At the present time, insect intelligence is a particular focus of research and development because insects and their behavior are easier to mimic. Nanobots could be based on insect behavior, working in swarms together to perform a function.</p>

                <p class="factsParagraph">Simple problem-solving can be accomplished by an AI robot through the process of gathering facts about a situation, then comparing this information to stored data, running through various possible actions and predicting which action will be most successful. Chess-playing robots are one example of this kind of machine.</p>

                <p class="factsParagraph">Other kinds of robots have been designed with the ability to “learn” in different ways. Some robots can learn by mimicking human actions and have been taught to dance by scientists demonstrating dance moves. Other kinds of robots can learn to use information from previous activities to make future decisions. These learning robots recognize if a certain action (moving its legs in a certain way, for instance) achieved a desired result (navigating an obstacle). The robot stores this information and attempts the successful action the next time it encounters the same situation. In other examples, a robot that fills a box with cookies might be able to “count” the number of cookies in the box, or a robot could determine the amount of traffic on a street to calculate when to change the light. This science is in the early stages, but robots are being developed that can make decisions in order to serve food, translate words from one language to another, and get information from outside resources to solve problems.</p>
